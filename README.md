# Hotboil
The Hotboil project is a fullstack, batteries included a web application starter template with a semi-opinionated tech stack.

# Motivation
The increasing complexity of software development forces us to take two steps back (at least me) and check if there is a different path.
Do I need a React/Angular/Vue/Blazor/Svelte application with a bunch of microservices around for my CRUDish app? Probably not.

This project will aim to be a part of a current movement that tries to bring back sanity to web development and stop overengineering simple things.
